How It Works:
HTML: Defines the structure of the page, including a textarea for input and a button to trigger the speech.
CSS: Styles the page to make it look neat and centered.
JavaScript: Uses the Web Speech API's SpeechSynthesis interface to convert the text into speech when the button is clicked.
You can further enhance this by adding more features, such as changing the voice, adjusting the speech rate, or adding language options.
